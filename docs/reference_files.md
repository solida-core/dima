## REFERENCE DOWNLOADER

To facilitate users in reference organization, we developed a simple script aimed at downloading and correctly placing reference files.
The script is part of a *[TOOLKIT](https://github.com/solida-core/toolkit#solida-core-toolkit)* where useful pipeline-related scripts will be collected.

**INSTALL and RUN:**  **[reference_organizer](https://github.com/solida-core/toolkit#reference_organizerpy)**
